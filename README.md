# papi â€” Performance Application Programming Interface for OCaml

%%VERSION%%

Papi provides OCaml bindings to
[PAPI (Performance Application Programming Interface)][papi-home], a C library
for portable access to hardware performance counters.

The bindings closely follow PAPI's [own interface][papi-docs]. As a consequence,
the multitude of errors that PAPI can signal are propagated to OCaml. User is
advised to at least skim the PAPI documentation.

Papi depends on the PAPI C library, version 5.4 or above.

Papi is distributed under the ISC license.
