# papi â€” Performance Application Programming Interface for OCaml

%%VERSION%%

papi is a binding for PAPI, the
[Performance Application Programming Interface][papi-home].
It gives access to hardware performance counters in a way that is portable
across architectures and operating systems.

The bindings closely follow PAPI's [own interface][papi-docs]. As a consequence,
the multitude of errors that PAPI can signal are propagated to OCaml. User is
advised to at least skim the PAPI documentation.

papi is distributed under the ISC license.
